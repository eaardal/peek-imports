## [1.0.0] - 2022-04-27

### Changed

- Renamed extension from Peeky to Peek Imports. The package name `eaardal.peeky` is maintained to avoid publishing a new extension.
- Renamed command display name `Peeky: Peek Imports` to just `Peek Imports`.
- Renamed command id `peeky.peekImports` to `peekimports.peekImports`. Breaks custom keybindings that targetted the old command id.

## [0.0.4] - 2021-07-02

### Added

- Extension works, first release.
